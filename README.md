# Snake
Requires the pygame library to be installed on your system, the game also uses numpy and time, but those were included, at least on my system. the file Snakegame contains the full release.
Snakeattempt1 exists mainly for comparing releases as i get better, as i am still not completely happy with the programme, and i might come back to Snake as i become a better programmer in order to improve it, and at that point it would be nice to compare releases
